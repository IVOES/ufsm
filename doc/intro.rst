Introduction
============

uFSM is a set of tools for creating hierarchical state machines.

As of writing this uFSM only supports C and was from the begining mainly indended
to be used in embedded systems. There is however work being done to support
other languages as well.

State machine models are created using the 'ufsm-compose' tool. Models are
translated to code using the 'ufsm-generate' tool.
